Feature: Administrator viewing client profiles and being able to approve/reject them
  As an ORAM administrator
  In order to mark client refugees statuses as approved, rejected, or incomplete
  I want to be able to see a table of all clients and be able to view their individual profiles

Background: Clients in the database and logged in as an admin
  Given the following clients exist:
    | first_name  | last_name   | email                 | password     	  | role					| invitation_accepted_at | phase    |
    | Bryan       | Adams     	| bryan@adams.com       | oram123         | client			  | 'test'                 | Phase 1|
    | George      | Clooney     | george@clooney.com    | oram123         | client			  | 'test'                 | Phase 3|
    | Michael     | Jordan    	| michael@jordan.com    | oram123         | client			  | 'test'                 | Phase 4|
    | Joe         | Bob     	  | joe@bob.com           | oram123         | client			  | 'test'                 | Phase 5|

  And I am logged in as the following admin:
    | first_name  | last_name | email               | password   | role     |
    | oram        | admin     | admin321@gmail.com  | oramadmin  | central  |

Scenario: Admin viewing the list of clients
  Given I follow "Clients"
  Then I should see "Bryan"
  Then I should see "George"
  Then I should see "Michael"
  Then I should see "Joe"
  And the phase of "Michael Jordan" should be "Phase 4"
  And the phase of "George Clooney" should be "Phase 3"

Scenario: Admin changing client phase
  Given I follow "Clients"
  Given I view the profile of "George Clooney"
  When I select "Phase 4" from the change phase dropdown
  And I press "Change Phase"
  And I follow "Clients"
  Then the phase of "George Clooney" should be "Phase 4"
 
 Scenario: Admin changing client phase generates an event
  Given I follow "Clients"
  Given I view the profile of "George Clooney"
  When I select "Phase 5" from the change phase dropdown
  And I press "Change Phase"
  Then I should see "Last Activity:"
  And I should see "George Clooney has been moved from Phase 3 to Phase 5"
